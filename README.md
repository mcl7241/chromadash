an interactive game: match the colors!
Chromadash Guide

Hello! 

Welcome to Chromadash! When you run the application, it will take you to the first welcome page which uses a delay and then moves to the next screen (first feature). Then moving to the next layout, I have explained all the game rules and have given the user as long as they need to read it before starting the game. Clicking the start button will activate the game where there is a 60 sec timer (second feature) to get the maximum score possible. The more you match the colors, the higher your score is. When a collision occurs, then there is text to speech that tells you a collision is detected which is the third feature. After 60 seconds is up, your score is displayed and you can either navigate to the home screen to play again or view graphs of your previous score to see your (hopefully) improving score. 

Have Fun!
